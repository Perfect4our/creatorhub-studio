- **Recording tips**: Technical requirements and best practices
- **Key points**: What Google reviewers need to see

## üìã **Immediate Action Plan**

### **Step 1: Record Demo Video (Today)**
1. **Use the script** in `DEMO_VIDEO_SCRIPT.md`
2. **Record in 1080p** using OBS, ScreenFlow, or similar
3. **Show your production app** at creatorhubstudio.com
4. **Demonstrate OAuth flow** with real YouTube account
5. **Upload to YouTube** (unlisted) or Vimeo

### **Step 2: Google Cloud Console Setup (Today)**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a **separate production project** (don't use existing dev project)
3. Enable **YouTube Data API v3** and **YouTube Analytics API**
4. Configure **OAuth consent screen** with:
   - **App Name**: CreatorHub Studio
   - **Homepage**: https://creatorhubstudio.com
   - **Privacy Policy**: https://creatorhubstudio.com/privacy
   - **Terms of Service**: https://creatorhubstudio.com/terms
   - **Support Email**: support@creatorhubstudio.com

### **Step 3: Domain Verification (Today)**

2. **Add creatorhubstudio.com** as a property
3. **Verify ownership** using DNS record method
4. **Use same Google account** as your Cloud Console project owner

### **Step 4: OAuth Scopes & Justification (Today)**
Add these scopes with the provided justifications:

**YouTube Read-Only Access**:
```
Scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly
Justification: "Our app needs to access basic YouTube channel information including channel details, video lists, and basic video metadata to display content performance in the creator dashboard. This read-only access is essential for showing creators their own video titles, thumbnails, and basic statistics."
```

**YouTube Analytics Read-Only**:
```
Scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/yt-analytics.readonly  
Justification: "Our app requires access to YouTube Analytics data to provide creators with detailed performance insights including view counts, watch time, subscriber growth, and demographic data. This is the core functionality of our analytics dashboard that helps creators understand their audience and content performance. We only access the creator's own analytics data and display it in an organized dashboard format."
```

**YouTube Analytics Monetary Read-Only**:
```
Scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/yt-analytics-monetary.readonly
Justification: "Our app needs access to YouTube monetization data to provide creators with revenue insights and estimated earnings information. This helps creators track their monetization performance alongside their content analytics. We only access the creator's own revenue data and display it securely in their private dashboard."
```

### **Step 5: Submit for Verification (Today)**
1. **Publish app** from testing to production
2. **Upload demo video** to verification form
3. **Submit for review**
4. **Monitor email** for Google's response

## üéØ **Expected Timeline**

- **Brand Verification**: 2-3 business days
- **Sensitive Scopes**: 2-4 weeks  
- **Restricted Scopes**: 4-8 weeks (includes security assessment)

## üîß **Production OAuth Configuration**

When setting up your production OAuth client, use these settings:

### **Client Configuration**:
- **Application Type**: Web application
- **Authorized JavaScript Origins**: 
  - `https://creatorhubstudio.com`
- **Authorized Redirect URIs**:
  - `https://creatorhubstudio.com/auth/youtube/callback`
  - `https://creatorhubstudio.com/auth/google/callback`

### **Environment Variables for Production**:
Update your Heroku config with the production OAuth credentials:
```bash
# After creating production OAuth client
heroku config:set YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID="your-production-client-id"
heroku config:set YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-production-client-secret"
```
